I'm always trying new technologies, taking courses and building new projects. I'm mainly interested in Machine Learning and Big Data but I'm not limited
to just those topics. The goal of this blog in to have a place where I can write, in a very casual way, my experiences as I try new things. Some posts will
be very short, with just a few lines with notes about how to do something quick. Others will be longer, with more elaborated explanations and details.

Hopefully this blog can be useful for other people that are struggling with some of the things I struggled with when I was learning them in the first place.
It'll definitely be helpful for me when I need to remember how I achieved specific things so I can repeat the same process.

I'm a complete newbie about some of the topics I'll be covering and with this blog I wont be trying to give expert advice of any type.

Let's do some tinkering around!
